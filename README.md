# Yusuf İşbilir

Frontend Engineer focused on **Architecture, Performance, and Simplicity**.

I design user-facing systems where **clarity, predictability, and scalability** matter more than visual noise.  
My work emphasizes explicit trade-offs, solid abstractions, and long-term maintainability.


## 🧠 Focus Areas

- Frontend Architecture (React / Next.js)
- Friendship with BaaS providers (e.g., Supabase)
- Performance Engineering & Rendering Strategies
- State, Data Flow, and Cache Design
- Clean Code, SRP, and Minimalist System Design

## 🛠️ Philosophy

- Architecture > Framework hype  
- Performance is a feature, not an optimization
> *“As AI writes more code, engineers are paid to decide **what should exist**.”*
